# Prototype-RI_DLT_Salesforce_Alternaltive

This was my senior project. 
I worked with the Rhode Island's Department of Labor and Transportaion to create an alternative to salesforce. 
This was proposed to raise money for the school and save money for the client (RIDLT) 

Please note most of the project files have not been uploaded - the focus being the c sharp files.
