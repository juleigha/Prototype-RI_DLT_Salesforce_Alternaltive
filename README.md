# Prototype-RI_DLT_Salesforce_Alternaltive

This was my senior project 2015. 
I worked with the Rhode Island's Department of Labor and Transportaion to create an alternative to salesforce. 
This was proposed to raise money for the school and save money for the client (RIDLT) 

Please note most of the project files have not been uploaded - the focus being the c sharp files. 

Although this prototype impressed my professor and the process it follows was shared with the RI DLT, I really hate the code here. It was extremly rushed, and at the end of the day, it only demontrates my teams idea for the process they should follow. It has very little scalability and is basically spaghetti.
